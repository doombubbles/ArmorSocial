AntiSocial mod but for armor. Currently I've only coded the set bonuses to work.

Some Notes:
    Some set bonuses will stack with themselves, others won't. Anyways, I think it's more fun to just use different ones.
    Shroomite Stealth is hard-coded into the game to override Vortex stealth. Sorry.
    I've added the damage reduction from the Spectre (Healing) Hood to it's set bonus so it's not brain-dead broken
