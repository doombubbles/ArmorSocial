# ArmorSocial

AntiSocial mod but for armor. Currently I've only coded the set bonuses to work.

Some Notes:

Some set bonuses will stack with themselves, others won't. Anyways, I think it's more fun to just use different ones.

Shroomite Stealth is hard-coded into the game to override Vortex stealth. Sorry.

I've added the damage reduction from the Spectre (Healing) Hood to it's set bonus so it's not brain-dead broken

Currently, vanilla armor sets will have their vanilla set bonuses, not ones added/changed by mods.
