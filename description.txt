AntiSocial mod but for armor. Now with customizable features.

Modes:
Set Bonuses Only: Only a full Vanity Set Bonus will give you any benefit
All Except Defense: All the bonuses of Vanity Armor applied except for defense
Everything: Self explanatory lol

Spectre Healing Balance: Toggle for Spectre Healing Set Bonus in Vanity to reduce magic damage by 40% when on Set Bonuses Only mode

Some Notes:

Some set bonuses will stack with themselves, others won't. Anyways, I think it's more fun to just use different ones.

Shroomite Stealth is hard-coded into the game to override Vortex stealth. Sorry.
